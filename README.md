## About the project

This project is a part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program of Udacity. As a student I received a starter code with HTML and CSS to display a static version of the Memory Game project. My goal was to add functionality and make the game interactive by using JavaScript, some HTML and CSS.

## How to play

The purpose of this game is to test players memory. A player is given a deck that contains 8 pairs of matched cards. At the beginning of the game the cards with symbols are turned over. When a player clicks on a card, the symbol is revealed. If a player opens two cards with the same symbol, those cards remain open. The goal is to match all cards.
